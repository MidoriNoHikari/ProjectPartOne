	    It is my quest to become a computer engineer, so I am attending the University of Pittsburgh to help reach that goal. While here at the University I have taken a variety of classes that I hope will prepare me for my future career. I have been fairly consistent with maintaining a 3.0 GPA since freshman year, but I hope to bring it up a little higher in the semesters to come. As a side note, I am also trying to minor in Japanese, but I am yet to see if I'll be able to squeeze it in by the end of my college career.

	  <p>My highschool education was pretty standard. I graduated third in my class (I could have been valedictorian, but I didn't want to give another speech so I opted out of some available extra credit). I graduated from the E.L. Meyers High School in Wilkes-Barre, PA.</p>
