	  Hello! Welcome to the personal webpage of Matthew Snyder. A project designed and created as part of CS1520 - Programming Languages for Web Applications. I'm glad you're taking the time to visit my site, perhaps you'll be inspired to make your own site as well some day, but maybe not. Either way, enjoy!
